Dear All,

Finally the moment has arrived to say goodbye, which is never easy, especially when you have been part of the Cargoflash family for more than a years .It has been a fantastic journey and a great learning experience.
The people here at Cargoflash have honestly been one of the best parts of working here.

Hearty Thanks to all my colleagues [Rishabh, Sandhya, Trilok, Shubham, Uttam, Nehal, Ankit, Mukesh] and all support team members who were always there for me.
Sincere special thanks to my Seniors  "Umar Sir", "Devender Sir", "Parvez Sir".
